# Network Pioneers Cup 2023 Write-Up

## Overview

This project was part of the **Network Pioneers Cup 2023**, where our team of three members was tasked with designing and implementing a secure network using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. We are proud to have won **1st place** in the competition!

## Objective
The goal was to build a secure, scalable, and reliable network while following best practices for:
- **Network Segmentation** using VLANs
- **Access Control** with ACLs and firewalls
- **Remote Access** using VPNs
- **Redundancy** with HSRP for high availability

## Approach
1. **Design**: We planned the network with secure VLAN segmentation and ACLs to ensure proper access control.
2. **Implementation**: Using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, we configured routers, switches, firewalls, and VPNs.
3. **Testing**: We validated the network with connectivity tests and access control checks.
4. **Presentation**: We presented our network infrastructure, highlighting security measures and design decisions. The final quiz also contributed to our victory.

## Technologies Used

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**
- **VLANs, ACLs, VPN, HSRP**
